# # collection in python
# # Lists?
# # lists are MUTABLE
# # we can add, remove, change an item in the list
# # indexing starts with 0 for each item in list
# # Syntax ["yoghurt", "apple", "milk"]
#
# # Let's create a list
#
# shopping_list = ["apple", "milk", "bread"]
# print(shopping_list[0])
# print(type(shopping_list))
#
# shopping_list.append("eggs")
# # append method adds an item at the end of the list
# print(shopping_list)
#
# # How can you remove an item from our list
# shopping_list.remove("apple")
# print(shopping_list)
#
# # How can we remove the last item of our list
# shopping_list.pop()
# print(shopping_list)
#
# # How can i replace something in my list
# shopping_list[1] = "fruits"
# print(shopping_list)

# Can we have a mix of data types in the list

mixed_shopping_list = [1, 2, 3, "apple", "milk", "bread"]
print(mixed_shopping_list)

# Task: create a mixed data type list of 7 items
# display the type of data
# add, delete, replace, pop
# use indexing to print the list in reverse
# 10 mins to complete
